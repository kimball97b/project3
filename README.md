what am I doing

update: i kinda know what im doing now. I just gotta sort through 736725 lines of logs

update: I read that the professor will check the repository but the repository isn't picking up changes while I'm in vagrant so I dont know how this'll work

Update: I think I'm finished with the project but I'm kinda worried about the Github part of the project. The only history I have to show is the README file.

Got python code into GITHUB but i hope i did it right with all this weird branch, pull requests and merging.
